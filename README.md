#Beginner: CLI Tools

## Configuring environment:
• ROS 2 relies on the notion of combining workspaces using the shell environment. “Workspace” is a ROS term for the location on your system where you’re developing with ROS 2. The core ROS 2 workspace is called the underlay. Subsequent local workspaces are called overlays. When developing with ROS 2, you will typically have several workspaces active concurrently.

• Combining workspaces makes developing against different versions of ROS 2, or against different sets of packages, easier. It also allows the installation of several ROS 2 distributions (or “distros”, e.g. Dashing and Eloquent) on the same computer and switching between them.

• This is accomplished by sourcing setup files every time you open a new shell, or by adding the source command to your shell startup script once. Without sourcing the setup files, you won’t be able to access ROS 2 commands or find or use ROS 2 packages. In other words, you won’t be able to use ROS 2.

• Prerequisites
• Before starting these tutorials, install ROS 2 by following the instructions on the ROS 2 Installation page.
